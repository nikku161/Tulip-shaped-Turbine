# Tulip-shaped-Turbine
AIM:
Comparative analysis of efficiency enhancement in 2 blade, Tulip-shaped and conventional
3-blade wind turbines and exploring so-called “tulips” as a possible solution to energy eyesores.
BACKGROUND:
As a clean and renewable energy source, wind energy is seen by many as a way to partially
solve our nation’s energy crisis. Wind energy has grown by leaps and bounds in recent
years.Fluid mechanics can help us analyze the mechanisms of wind flow occurring in nature
and understand various factors it is dependent upon. We can use this study of fluid mechanics
for various applications ,one being energy generation. Thus, we are researching various pros
and cons of tulip shaped turbines and what role fluid mechanics play in
